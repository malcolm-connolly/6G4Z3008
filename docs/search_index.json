For example, if one drops a ball from a height, we know it will hit the ground. Things that happen like this can be decribed as deterministic. You may have heard people talk about things being written in the stars, or their fate, or destiny. The opinion that all things are pre-determined is called determinism. However, even if are a determinist, you will have to live with uncertainty. In our everyday lives we can think of examples where things happen that we cannot predict; a bus may be late, it may rain, or one might win the lottery. To one living with uncertainty, it is reasonable to quantify this uncertainty and act assuming outcomes are not pre-determined. If the outcome is not pre-determined then it is called random. The Mathematics of random phenomena is called Probability Theory. Most people have an intuitive idea of what is meant by probability or chance. Unfortunately Probability Theory is a subject in which there are endless examples of seemingly simple questions that turn out to be very complicated or have severely counter-intuitive answers. 1.1 What is probability? We need to start with some terminology. Definition 1.1 An experiment is any procedure with a random outcome. For example rolling a die and observing the score is a statistical experiment Probability is a measure of likelihood or chance, on a scale from \\(0\\) to \\(1\\). 1.2 Outcomes and counting 1.3 Independence and mutual exclusivity "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
