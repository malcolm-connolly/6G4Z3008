<p>In this chapter we will learn about conditional probability. This is the probability of an event, in the context of another event having happened or potentially happening.</p>
<div id="independence" class="section level2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Independence<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#independence"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Independence is a very important concept in Statistics, but one that is sometimes misused when it is assumed without justification. The basic idea is as follows:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:unlabeled-div-41" class="definition"><strong>Definition 2.1  (Independence) </strong></span>Two events <span class="math inline">\(\text{A}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\text{B}\)</span> are <strong><em>independent</em></strong> exactly when
<span class="math display">\[\text{P}(\text{A}\cap\text{B}) = \text{P}(\text{A})\times \text{P}(\text{B}).\]</span>
In words this means the probability that both <span class="math inline">\(\text{A}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\text{B}\)</span> happen is the product of the individual probabilities of <span class="math inline">\(\text{A}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\text{B}\)</span> respectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-42" class="example"><strong>Example 2.1  </strong></span>Some events that can be modelled as <strong><em>independent</em></strong> include:
- Outcomes on successive tosses of a coin or die. What happened on the previous throw does not affect what happens on subsequent throws.</p>
<ul>
<li>The sex of babies. The sex of each baby is determined at random, notwithstanding the sexes of previous babies.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-43" class="example"><strong>Example 2.2  </strong></span>Suppose a power plant has two safety systems, a primary system which works with probability <span class="math inline">\(0.999\)</span>, and a backup system which works with probability <span class="math inline">\(0.89\)</span> Assuming that the two systems operate independently, what is the reliability or safety of the power plant.</p>
<p><em>solution</em></p>
<p>We can work out <span class="math inline">\(\text{P}(\text{plant safe})\)</span> using the complement:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{P}(\text{plant safe}) = 1-\text{P}(\text{plant fails}).\]</span></p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> be the event that the plant fails, <span class="math inline">\(F_1\)</span> the event that the first system fails, and <span class="math inline">\(F_2\)</span> the backup fails.</p>
<p>Then <span class="math inline">\(F = F_1 \cap F_2\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\text{P}(F) &amp;= \text{P}(F_1 \cap F_2) \\
&amp;= \text{P}(F_1) \times \text{P}(F_2) \\
&amp;= (1-0.999)\times (1-0.89) \\
&amp;= 0.00011
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>Then <span class="math inline">\(1-0.00011 = 0.99989\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Calculations such as these have often been used to arrive at unrealistic figures for the safety of complex operating processes, e.g. nuclear power plants. For example, it’s easy to check that with three backup systems each with a reliability of <span class="math inline">\(0.99\)</span>, the probability of failure assuming independence is <span class="math inline">\(1\times 10^{-6}\)</span> - a reassuringly small figure! However we can only make calculations <em>if</em> we can justify the assumption of independence. For example it’s not unusual to find that backup systems that are not used very often can be more unreliable than supposed when actually called upon.</p>
<p>You might have to give a reason why a particular context is not a good example in which to assume independence. For example <strong><em>exercise</em></strong> <a href="index.html#exr:invest">1.3</a> part (c) asks why two investments may not be independent. There are many reasonable answers. Similar companies are dependent - if the companies are both bakeries, they may both be affected by the price of wheat. The companies may be competitors, in which case one company doing better may cause the other to do worse.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-44" class="example"><strong>Example 2.3  </strong></span>Suppose you toss ten coins and coin how many are Heads. You could throw them all simultaneously. Or you could throw them one at a time, in some order. Does it matter?</p>
<p><em>solution</em></p>
<p>No, as these are independent coins. Let
<span class="math display">\[A_i =\{\text{The} \ i^{\text{th}} \ \text{coin is Heads} \}\]</span></p>
<p>The probability that they are simultaneously all Heads is the product of all the probabilities of each individual coin being Heads.
Notice that the order does not matter as
<span class="math display">\[\text{P}(\text{A}_i)\times \text{P}(\text{A}_j) = \text{P}(\text{A}_j)\times \text{P}(\text{A}_i).\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Assuming independence allows us to consider simultaneous events separately one after another, complicated examples can be analysed easily using tree diagrams. Each path of a tree diagram from the root to the leaf is a distinct outcome of the sample space.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-45" class="example"><strong>Example 2.4  </strong></span>Vehicles approaching a crossroads must go in one of three directions - left, right or straight on. Observations by traffic engineers showed that of vehicles approaching from the north, <span class="math inline">\(45\%\)</span> turn left, <span class="math inline">\(20\%\)</span> turn right and <span class="math inline">\(35\%\)</span> go straight on. Assuming that the driver of each vehicle chooses direction independently, what is the probability that of the next three vehicles approaching from the north:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>all go straight on</p></li>
<li><p>all go in the same direction</p></li>
<li><p>two turn left and one turns right</p></li>
<li><p>all go in different directions</p></li>
<li><p>exactly two turn left.</p></li>

<p>We will consider the following examples to motivate the definition of conditional probability.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-46" class="example"><strong>Example 2.5  </strong></span>The number of insurance claims in the previous <span class="math inline">\(12\)</span> months is cross tabulated with whether the driver involved was a young driver.</p>

</div>
<p>The insurance company is interested in the claim rate. Overall the claim rate is,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{P}(\text{Claim})=\frac{50}{1000} = 0.05\]</span></p>
<p>An estimate for the probability of a driver claiming on the insurance is then <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span>.</p>
<p>However this figure hides a substantial difference in the claim rates for young and older drivers.</p>
<p>If we consider the <span class="math inline">\(250\)</span> young drivers separately we have,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{P}(\text{Claim}|\text{Under}\ 25)=\frac{25}{250} = 0.1.\]</span>
Whereas for the <span class="math inline">\(750\)</span> older drivers we have,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{P}(\text{Claim}| 25 \ \text{and over})=\frac{25}{750} = 0.03.\]</span></p>
<p>The notation <span class="math inline">\(|\)</span> is read ‘given that’ and is a conditional statement. The conditional probabilities show that the claim rate is much higher for the younger drivers. One can compute the ratio of these probabilities to see how many times higher it is, <span class="math inline">\(0.1/0.03 \approx 3.3\)</span>, so this is just over three times higher. This relative risk scoring is common in medical statistics.</p>

<p>Because the intersection of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> with another set is contained in <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(A\cap B \subseteq B\)</span>, and so

<span class="math display">\[\text{P}(A|B) = \text{P}(A) \ \text{ or } \ \text{P}(B|A) = \text{P}(B)\]</span>
In other words, conditioning on either event does not affect the probability of the other event occurring.</p>

<div class="proof">
<p><span id="unlabeled-div-52" class="proof"><em>Proof</em>. </span>Using the definition of conditional probability,

substituting this in the former yields

which is the definition of independence.
Conversely if two events are independent, we have

If one day he goes to campus by bike, the probability that he goes to campus by tram the next day is <span class="math inline">\(0.4\)</span>.

Given that Jon goes to campus on Monday by tram, find the probability that he takes a tram to campus on Wednesday.</p>

<p>This may be solved by considering a tree diagram with levels for Tuesday and Wednesday. The probabilities in the question are <span class="math inline">\(\text{P}(\text{tram} \ |\ \text{bike})=0.4\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\text{P}(\text{bike} \ |\ \text{tram})=0.7\)</span>.
Monday’s journey is done. Possible sequences are ‘tram then tram’, or ‘bike then tram’. These are mutually exclusive outcomes. The calculation is then</p>

<p>Surveys with questions of a sensitive or delicate nature often result in respondents missing that question or lying about their answers. Conditional probability can be used to mask the awkward question and find the proportion who would answer a certain way.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-54" class="example"><strong>Example 2.9  </strong></span>A company want to find the proportion of employees who have ever called in sick to work, when in fact they were not sick. The boss asks each employee to toss a coin and hide the result.</p>

<p>If the result is <strong><em>tails</em></strong>, they should answer ‘Have you ever taken a day off when you should not have?’.</p>
<p>Because the boss does not know which question people are answering, the employees can answer truthfully.</p>
<p>Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(40\%\)</span> of employees mark ‘yes’ as their answer. Let,</p>

<p><em>solution</em></p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> be the event that the component is defective and <span class="math inline">\(S_1,S_2,S_3\)</span> denotethat it was produced during shifts <span class="math inline">\(1,2\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> respectively.</p>

</div>
<p>Bayes’ theorem allows us to update the probability of an event in the light of new evidence. This is in fact the main practical use of the theorem, and leads to a whole branch of Bayesian Statistics.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-61" class="example"><strong>Example 2.12  </strong></span>Gary is suspected of committing a crime. The evidence so far points to a probability of guilt being <span class="math inline">\(0.9\)</span>. To ‘prove his innocence’ Gary undergoes a lie detector test, which has a <span class="math inline">\(70\%\)</span> accuracy rate. The test will say positive to indicate guilt, and negative to indicate not guilty. The test is such that
<span class="math display">\[\text{P}(\text{Positive}|\text{Guilty}) = 0.7\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[\text{P}(\text{Negative}|\text{Innocent})=0.7\]</span></p>
<p>If Gary’s test comes back <strong><em>negative</em></strong>, what is then the probability of his guilt?</p>
<p><em>solution</em></p>
<p>One can directly apply Bayes’ theorem.
<span class="math display">\[\text{P}(\text{Guilt}|\text{Negative})=\frac{\text{P}(\text{Negative}|\text{Guilt})\text{P}(\text{Guilt})}{\text{P}(\text{Negative}|\text{Guilt})\text{P}(\text{Guilt})+\text{P}(\text{Negative}|\text{Innocent})\text{P}(\text{Innocent})}\]</span>
and so
<span class="math display">\[\text{P}(\text{Guilt}|\text{Negative})=\frac{0.3\times 0.9}{0.3\times 0.9 \ + \ 0.7\times 0.1}=0.794 \ \text{(3 d.p.)}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Beware of having extreme prior beliefs, for no evidence can then change your mind. Believing something to be true <span class="math inline">\(100\%\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(0\%\)</span>, will mean that no reason or evidence will change this position.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-62" class="example"><strong>Example 2.13  (Cromwell's Rule) </strong></span>If we believe Gary is <span class="math inline">\(100\%\)</span> guilty at the start then
<span class="math display">\[\text{P}(\text{Guilt}|\text{Negative})=\frac{0.3\times 1}{0.3\times 1 \ + \ 0.7\times 0}=1\]</span>
So we would still believe Gary to be <span class="math inline">\(100\%\)</span> guilty.</p>
<p>If we believe Gary is <span class="math inline">\(0\%\)</span> guilty at the start then
<span class="math display">\[\text{P}(\text{Guilt}|\text{Negative})=\frac{0.3\times 0}{0.3\times 0 \ + \ 0.7\times 1}=0\]</span>
So we would still believe Gary to be <span class="math inline">\(0\%\)</span> guilty.</p>
</div>
<p>As educated people we should always consider the opposing opinion and update our own beliefs according to the evidence available. If you have a strong opinion about something, consider what would change your mind. Always leave some room to doubt yourself, because you could be wrong.</p>
