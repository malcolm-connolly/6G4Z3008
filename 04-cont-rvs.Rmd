# Continuous random variables {#cont}

In this chapter we will learn about continuous random variables. Here the random variable may arise from a measurement process. 

In real life many observations are assumed to take real numbered values. We could in principle observe any value on a _continuum_. For example:

- The lifetime of a lithium-ion battery

- The weight of a baby

- The height of a random person

In practice we are constrained by the accuracy of our measuring device (heights are often quoted to the nearest inch, or centimeter) and the distinction between discrete and continuous is sometimes blurred. 

:::{.example}
Consider a class of undergraduates at MMU. Each of the following is a measurement of age:

a. Age to the nearest decade

b. Age in years

c. Age in months

d. Age in days

e. Age in seconds
:::

Although none of the variables is strictly measured on a continuous scale, we would measure these variables differently. The decades would only take at most a few particular values and could be modelled as discrete, whereas age in seconds could take so many different values it's almost continuous.

## Relation to histograms

Given some actual continuous data, one could make a plot how frequently the data lies within certain intervals. The resulting plot is called a histogram. These intervals need not be equal, but in modern practice they are. In most computer implementations the intervals are called bins and the interval size the bin width. 

A classic example built into R is the Old Faithful geyser data. Here the waiting times between eruptions and the duration of the eruption were recorded for the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA.

Suppose you want to estimate a proportion or probability of a particularly long waiting time. Then instead of the bar height being equal to the frequency we can set the area to be proportional to the frequency. This can be done in such a way as to make the total area under the histogram equal to $1$.

```{r faithful, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Waiting time between eruptions, one sees the data in more precision with smaller bin width"}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))

hist(faithful$waiting, 
     main = "Interval size 10", 
     xlab = "Waiting Time (in minutes)",
     breaks = 5,
     freq = FALSE)

hist(faithful$waiting, 
     main = "Interval size 5", 
     xlab = "Waiting Time (in minutes)",
     breaks = 10,
     freq = FALSE)

hist(faithful$waiting, 
     main = "Interval size 2", 
     xlab = "Waiting Time (in minutes)",
     breaks = 25,
     freq = FALSE)


plot(density(faithful$waiting), main = "estimated density plot")
```

To find the proportion between two values one could total the area of the bars. One can see the limit of this idea, perhaps for a very large sample is that we would have a smooth curve like the plot titled 'estimated density', and find the area under the curve.  

## Two students 

Consider two students who have an appointment with their tutor at $12$-noon. 

The first student makes an effort to get there on time, so is more likely to be a little late than very late, as they live far from the university. They may be late but will certainly be there before $1$ o'clock. 
The second student has forgotten the appointment, but lives close to the university, so may arrive at any time before $1$ o'clock, as soon as they remember.

What is the sample space here?

Take $\Omega = [0,1]$ to be the delay measured in hours. An event here is an interval in which the student arrives. For example $[0,\frac{1}{2}]$ is the event that the student is no more than half an hour late. 

The probability of arriving in a given interval is the area under the curve $$f(x) = 2-2x \ ,\ \text{for all } x\in[0,1].$$

This is shown in the image below:

```{r student1, fig.align="center",out.width = "75%", fig.cap="density function for first student", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/student1.jpg")
```

The probability of the student arriving in the first half an hour, between $12:00$ and $12:30$, is $\frac{3}{4}$, whereas the probability of arriving in the last half an hour, between $12:30$ and $13:00$, is $\frac{1}{4}$.


The time until the second student arrives may be modelled by the function

$$f(x) = 1\ ,\ \text{for all } x\in[0,1].$$

This is called a _uniform density_ and reflects the fact that any time is equally likely.

```{r student2, fig.align="center",out.width = "75%", fig.cap="density function for second student", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/student2.jpg")
```

The probability related to this function is $\text{P}([a,b]) = b-a$.


Can you find an expression for $\text{P}([a,b])$ for the first student?



## The probability density function

For continuous  random variables the equivalent of the probability mass function is called the ***probability density function***.

While for discrete random variables it makes sense to ask what is the probability that $X$ takes some particular value $\text{P}(X=x)$, this is always zero in the continuous setting. Instead we as what is the probability of $X$ lying in an interval $\text{P}(a<X<b)$.

:::{.definition}
The ***probability density function***of a continuous random variable $X$ is a function such that

- The function is everywhere non-negative
$$f(x) \geq 0 \text{ for all } \ x\in \mathbb{R}$$

- The probability of $X$ taking a value in the interval $(a,b)$ is given by the corresponding integral of that curve with respect to $x$.

$$\text{P}(a<X<b) = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \  dx$$

- The total area under the graph over the domain of $f(x)$ is unity. Let the domain of $f(x)$ be $x\in (c,d)$.

$$ \int_{c}^{d} f(x) \  dx = 1$$
:::

:::{.example}
The continuous random variable $X$ has probability density function given by 

\begin{equation*}
  f(x)=\begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{2}x, &  0< x < 2\\
    0 & \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

Calculate $\text{P}(X>1)$.

_solution_ 

you should do a sketch to get an intuition for whether the probability will be more than a half. 

You could use calculus here, but if you draw a picture the area required is a trapezium. 

The area is therefore $\frac{(\frac{1}{2}+1)\times 1}{2}=\frac{3}{4}$.

:::

:::{.example}
A continuous random variable has probability density function $f(x) = kx^2$ for $0\leq x\leq 4$. 

a) Find the value of the constant $k$

b) Find $\text{P}(1\leq X \leq 3)$

_solution_

a) 

We need to use calculus here as we have a curve. 

To find $k$, we use the fact that $f$ integrates to $1$ over the domain. 

$$ \int_{0}^{4}kx^2 \ dx = \left[ \frac{kx^3}{3}\right]^{x=4}_{x=0}$$

$$ 1= \frac{k}{3} (64-0)$$
$$ 1= \frac{64k}{3} $$
Hence $k=\frac{3}{64}$.


b) 
$$\text{P}(1\leq X \leq 3) = \int_{1}^{3} \frac{3}{64}x^2 \ dx$$

Evaluating this numerically gives $0.406$ to $3$ significant figures.
:::

Notice that if the inequality were $1<X<3$ or any combination of $<$ and $\leq$ the calculation would be the same, so we do not need to worry about the inequality being strict or not for continuous random variables.

This is because the area at a single $x$ value has zero width, so does not contribute to the integral. 

## Expectation and variance

The expectation is defined similarly to the case of discrete random variables, but here we use the integral rather than a sum.

:::{.definition}
The ***expectation***, or ***expected value*** or ***mean value*** of a continuous random variable $X$ is given by 

$$ \text{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x f(x) \ dx$$
Where the limits indicate that the integral is over the smallest and largest attainable values of $X$. The mean value is often denotes $\text{E}[X] = \mu$.

More generally we define

$$ \text{E}[g(X)] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}g(x) f(x) \ dx$$
:::

:::{.definition}
The variance of a continuous random variable is given by

$$\text{Var}[X] = \text{E}[(X-\mu)^2] = \text{E}[X^2]-\mu^2$$
The standard deviation $\sigma$ of $X$ is the square root of the variance. That is

$$\sigma = \sqrt{\text{Var}[X]}$$
:::

:::{.example name="marathon times"}
The times in excess of $2$ hours taken to complete a marathon road race are modelled by the continuous random variable $T$ hours, where $T$ has the probability density function

\begin{equation*}
  f(t)=\begin{cases}
    \frac{4}{27}t^2(3-t), &  0< x < 3\\
    0 & \ \ \ \  \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

Find the _mean_ and _standard deviation_ of the times taken to complete the race.
:::

_solution_

For the mean

$$ \text{E}[T] = \int_{0}^{3} t\times \frac{4}{27}t^2(3-t) \ dt$$

This can be evaluated (for example numerically) as $\frac{9}{5}$. This can be interpreted as $1$ hour and $48$ minutes excess of $2$ hours, so the mean time is $3$ hours and $48$ minutes.

The variance use $\text{Var}[T]=\text{E}[X^2]-\text{E}[X]^2 = \frac{18}{5} - (\frac{9}{5})^2 =\frac{9}{25}$. The interpretation is $21.6$ minutes variance, and so $\sigma = \sqrt{21.6} = 4.65$ minutes ($3$ s.f.) standard deviation

## Mode 

If the probability density function has a unique maximum then the value of $X$ at the maximum is called the mode. To locate the mode it is a good idea to draw a sketch. Sometimes the mode can be deduced immediately. Other times one may need to differentiate.


:::{.example}
Deduce the mode in the following cases

a) $$f(x) = \frac{1}{8}x , 0\leq x \leq 4$$

b) \begin{equation*}
  f(x)=\begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{4}x, &  0< x \leq 2 \\
    1-\frac{1}{4}x & \ \  2< x \leq 4 \\
    0& \ \ \ \ \  \ \ \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}


c) $$f(x) = \frac{3}{80}(2+x)(4-x) , \ \  0\leq x \leq 4.$$

_solution_

a) mode is 4

b) mode is 2

c) One could differentiate or complete the square here to show the mode is $1$.
:::


:::{.example name="marathon times"}
The times in excess of $2$ hours taken to complete a marathon road race are modelled by the continuous random variable $T$ hours, where $T$ has the probability density function

\begin{equation*}
  f(t)=\begin{cases}
    \frac{4}{27}t^2(3-t), &  0< x < 3\\
    0 & \ \ \ \  \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

Find the modal time taken to complete the race.
:::

_solution_

Differentiating gives

$$f'(t) = \frac{4}{27}(2t \times(3-t) + t^2\times(-1)) = \frac{4}{27}(6t -3t^2)$$

Setting $f'(t)=0$ yields

$$0 = 3t(2 - t) $$
So either$t=0$ or $2$. So the modal excess is $2$ hours, and the modal total time is $2+2=4$ hours.

## CDF

The cumulative distribution function can be defined in a similar way to discrete random variables.


:::{.definition}
The ***distribution function*** or more simply the ***CDF*** of a continuous random variable is the function defined by 

$$F(x) = \text{P}(X\leq x) = \text{P}(X< x).$$

The function $F$ is related to the density via

$$F(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{x}f(u) \ du$$
Where the lower limit $-\infty$ is in practice the lowest attainable value of $X$.

On the other hand,

$$ f(x) = \frac{d}{dx} F(x)$$
:::

These are some facts about the CDF.

- Since it is always impossible to have a value smaller than $-\infty$ or larger than $\infty$ we have $F(-\infty)=0$ and $F(\infty)=1$


- $F$ is called _monotonically increasing_ which means it either increases or remains constant but never decreases.


- $F$ is a continuous function, even if $f$ is not.


- Useful relations are 
$$\text{P}(c<X<d) = F(d) - F(c)$$

and 

$$ \text{P}(X>x) = 1-F(x)$$


:::{.example}
For a continuous random variable $X$ with density

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{8}x, \ 0\leq x\leq 4$$
a) Find the distribution function $F(x)$ and sketch it.

b) Evaluate $\text{P}(0.3\leq X\leq 1.8)$

_solution_

For values between $0$ and $4$ we have

$$F(t) = \int_{0}^{t} \frac{1}{8}x \ dx = \left[ \frac{x^2}{16}\right]^{t}_{0}= \frac{t^2}{16}$$ 

Altogether 

\begin{equation*}
  F(x)=\begin{cases}
        0 \ \ \ \ x\leq 0 \\
        \frac{x^2}{16} \ \ \   0\leq x \leq 4\\
        1 \ \ \ \ x\geq 4
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
:::


:::{.example}
For a continuous random variable $X$ with density

\begin{equation*}
  f(x)=\begin{cases}
        \frac{x}{3} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 0\leq x\leq 2  \\
        -\frac{2}{3}x+2 \ \ \   2\leq x \leq 3\\
        0 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \ \ \ \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}


a) Find the CDF F(x) and sketch it.

_solution_

The CDF must be found in two stages as $f$ is a piecewise function. 

Integrating over the interval $0\leq x\leq 2$ gives $\frac{x^2}{6}$

Integrating over the interval $2\leq x \leq 3$ gives $-\frac{x^2}{3} +2x -2$

Altogether 

\begin{equation*}
  F(x)=\begin{cases}
        \frac{x^2}{6} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 0\leq x\leq 2  \\
        -\frac{x^2}{3} +2x -2 \ \ \   2\leq x \leq 3\\
        0 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \ \ \ \ \  \ \ \ x\geq 3
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

:::

Generally speaking a plot or sketch of $F$ will look vaguely S-shaped. 

```{r cum1, fig.align="center",out.width = "75%", fig.cap="cumulative distribution function is S shaped", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/cum1.jpg")
```

For discrete random variables we sometimes called $f$ the distribution function and called $F$ the cumulative distribution function. However for continuous random variables $f$ is never called the distribution function, and only called the density function, and $F$ is called the distribution function exclusively. 



## median, quartiles and percentiles

The median, quartiles and percentiles are best expressed in terms of the CDF.

The median is the value $50\%$ of the way through the distribution. It splits the area under the curve $y=f(x)$ into two halves. 

:::{.definition}
The ***median*** of a continuous random variable $X$ is the value $m$ that satisfies either of

$$F(m) = 0.5 , \ \ \ \ \int_{-\infty}^{m}f(x) \ dx = 0.5$$
:::

:::{.definition}
The ***lower quartile*** $Q_1$ satisfies $F(Q_1) = 0.25$.
The ***upper quartile*** $Q_3$ satisfies $F(Q_3) = 0.75$.
The median is the second quartile $m=Q_2$.
:::

:::{.definition}
More generally one may define a ***percentile*** $P_{\alpha}$ at $\alpha \%$ to be the value such that $F(P_{\alpha})= \alpha \%$. The median is the $50^{\text{th}}$ percentile $m = P_{50}$, and $Q_1 = P_{25}$, $Q_3 = P_{75}$
:::

:::{.definition}
More generally still is the ***quantile*** which is the value $q$ such that $F(q)=p$ for any $p\in(0,1)$
:::

:::{.example}
Let's find the median for the marathon example.

\begin{equation*}
  f(t)=\begin{cases}
    \frac{4}{27}t^2(3-t), &  0< t < 3\\
    0 & \ \ \ \  \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

First find the CDF. 

In the range $0< t < 3$
$$F(t) = \frac{4}{27}\int_{0}^{t} u^2(3-u) \ du$$


$$= \frac{4}{27}\left[\frac{3u^3}{3}-\frac{u^4}{4}\right]^{t}_{0} =\frac{4}{27}\left( t^3 - \frac{t^4}{4} \right)$$

Then solving $F(t)=0.5$,

$$\frac{4}{27}\left(t^3 - \frac{t^4}{4} \right)= 0.5$$
this can be evaluated numerically and there are two values $t=3.74$ and $t= 1.84$ the first one is outside the range of $0< t < 3$ so is discarded. And so the median time is $2+1.84 = 3.84$ hours to complete the marathon. This is just under the mean.

:::


The marathon example shows that mode, median and mean are not the same number usually. The mode was $4$, the median was $3.84$ and the mean was $3.8$ hours. 


## Uniform distribution

We encountered a uniform random variable in the example of the forgetful student. Its characteristic is that for its entire domain of values of $X$ the density is constant.

If the density is a constant on some interval, that means $f(x) = k$ for $a\leq x \leq b$. What is the value of $k$?


:::{.definition}
A continuous random variable follows a continuous ***uniform distribution*** (sometimes called ***rectangular***) with support $[a,b]$, denoted $X\sim U(a,b)$ has probability density function given by

\begin{equation*}
  f(x)=\begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{b-a}, &  a< x < b\\
    0 & \ \ \ \  \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
:::

The uniform distribution is symmetrical so the mean is equal to the median, but there is no mode here.

:::{.theorem}
For a continuous uniform distribution $X\sim U(a,b)$

$$\text{E}[X] = \frac{a+b}{2}$$

and 

$$\text{Var}[X]= \frac{(b-a)^2}{12}$$
:::

:::{.proof}


$$\text{E}[X] = \int_a^b x \times \frac{1}{b-a} dx  =\frac{1}{b-a} \left[ \frac{x^2}{2} \right]^{b}_{a}$$

Now 

$$= \frac{1}{b-a} \left( \frac{b^2-a^2}{2} \right)$$
And using the difference of two squares

$$= \frac{1}{b-a} \left( \frac{(b-a)(b+a)}{2} \right)$$
Hence the result, upon cancelling $(b-a)$.

For the variance consider

$$\text{E}[X^2] = \int_a^b x^2 \times \frac{1}{b-a} dx  =\frac{1}{b-a} \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right]^{b}_{a}$$

$$= \frac{1}{b-a} \left( \frac{b^3-a^3}{3} \right)$$

And using the difference of cubes 

$$= \frac{1}{b-a} \left( \frac{(b-a)(b^2+ab+a^2)}{3} \right)$$

Hence $\text{E}[X^2] = \frac{b^2+ab+a^2}{3}$.

Now 

$$\text{Var}[X] = \text{E}[X^2] - \text{E}[X]^2 = \frac{b^2+ab+a^2}{3} - \left(\frac{a+b}{2} \right)^2$$

$$ = \frac{4(b^2+ab+a^2)- 3(a^2 + 2ab +b^2)}{12}$$
$$= \frac{a^2-2ab +b^2}{12}$$
Hence result by factorising the numerator.
:::

The CDF of the continuous uniform distribution can also be found.

:::{.proposition}
The CDF of a continuous uniform distribution $X\sim U(a,b)$ has the form 

\begin{equation*}
  F(x)=\begin{cases}
        0 & x \leq a \\
    \frac{x-a}{b-a}, &  a< x < b\\
    1 & \ \ x \geq b.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

:::

_proof_ 

Find the equation of the line between $(a,0)$ and $(b,1)$.



## Exponential distribution

The exponential distribution is like the continuous version of a geometric distribution. Instead of counting how many attempts until some event happens, we instead measure the time until an event occurs that would ordinarily occur at some rate.

Consider a sequence of independent events occuring at random points in time at a rate $\lambda$. We learned last week how the number of events that occur could be modelled by a discrete random variable called a Poisson distribution.

Instead of counting how many events occur, we could consider measuring how long we wait until the next event.

We set a starting time $x=0$ and denote the random variable 'the time to the first event' by $X$.

$$\text{P}(X>x) = \text{P}( \{\text{No events occur in the time interval (0,x)}\})$$

The mean number of events that occur per unit interval is $\lambda$. So the number of events that occur in the interval $(0,x)$ of length $x-0 = x$ is scaled proportionally so equals $\lambda \times x$.

The probability of obtaining $0$ events from a Poisson distribution with mean $\lambda x$ is 

$$\frac{(\lambda x)^0 e^{-\lambda x}}{0!} = e^{-\lambda x}$$
So 

$$\text{P}(X>x) =  e^{-\lambda x}$$
And the cumulative distribution equals

$$F(x) = 1-\text{P(X>x)}=1-e^{-\lambda x}$$

Differentiating this with respect to $x$ we obtain

$$f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$$

:::{.definition}
A continuous random variable $X$ is said to have an ***exponential distribution***, denoted $X\sim \text{Exp}(\lambda)$ if it has the density function

$$f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x} , x >0$$
:::

Now we will consider the shape of the exponential distribution.

:::{.theorem}
For an exponential distribution $X\sim \text{Exp}(\lambda)$, we have 

$$\text{E}[X] = \frac{1}{\lambda}$$
and

$$\text{Var}[X] = \frac{1}{\lambda ^2}$$
:::

:::{.proof}
This can be verified by using integration.

A box contains $12$ golf balls, $3$ of which are substandard. A random sample of $4$ balls is selected, without replacement, from the box.  The random variable $R$ denotes the number of balls in the sample that are substandard.

a) 
  (i) Show that the probability mass function of $R$ satisfies

$$\text{P}(R=r) = \frac{{}^3C_r \times {}^9C_{4-r}}{^{12}C_{4}}$$

(hint: count the number of choices out of the total number of ways. You may find it helpful to do the cases $r=0,1,2,3$ separately.)

  (ii) Determine the probability that $R=0$
  
  (iii) Determine the probability that there are fewer than two substandard balls.
